## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

2.  **Create a Firebase project:**

    *   Add a web app to your project.
    *   Enable Firestore and Authentication.
    *   In the Authentication section, add an admin user.
    *   In the Firestore section, update your security rules to the following:
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /clients/{clientId} {
              allow create: if true;
              allow read: if request.auth != null;
            }
            match /metadata/clients {
              allow read, write: if true;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
3.  **Add your Firebase configuration:**
    *   In your Firebase project settings, find your `firebaseConfig` object.
    *   Copy this object and paste it into the `firebase-config.js` file.
4.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser.**

## Future Improvements
